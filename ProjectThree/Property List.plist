		<string>We opened our first restaurant In Beverly Hills in 1985. Former federal prosecutors Rick Rosenfield and Larry Flax combined their passion for food with fresh high-quality ingredients to create innovative, hearth-baked pizzas such as The Original BBQ Chicken, Thai Chicken, and Jamaican Jerk Chicken, cooked in an open kitchen. The restaurant gave California a place in the pizza pantheon alongside Chicago and New York. Our California twist on global flavors resonated with guests, and almost immediately, CPK became a bustling spot for business and family gatherings.
Almost immediately after the first location opened, we expanded from California to more than 250 locations in more than 30 states and 11 countries. But it doesn&apos;t stop there; you&apos;ll also find us bringing smiles to the pizza aisle in your grocer&apos;s freezer, taking the edge off travel fatigue in major airports all over the world, feeding eager fans at sports stadiums and students on college campuses.
California Pizza Kitchen completed an initial public offering in August 2000 and traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker symbol CPKI. On July 7, 2011, Golden Gate Capital completed the acquisition of CPK and as a result of the acquisition, the company’s common stock is no longer publicly traded.
In January 2018, Jim Hyatt was named Chief Executive Officer.</string>
		<string>We didn’t set out to create just another create-your-own pizzeria. We’re here to nourish and inspire — to serve creativity — and celebrate people coming together to connect. It’s a bigger vision. One filled with purpose. For pizza, people and passion.
Before we embarked on our create-your-own pizza experience, our story began in the kitchen, with our founder, his wife and daughters, and a plan to share time together. From that day on, Pieology would forever be a fresh retreat from the everyday hustle and bustle -- where the only thing more important than quality food is quality people to share it with.</string>
		<string>Bringing people together to share joy has been our family&apos;s inspiration since opening the first Panda Express in 1983 in Glendale, California. As we continue to open restaurants from coast to coast and around the world, the bold flavors of Chinese cuisine inspire our cooking, while our extended family of guests and associates remains at the heart of what we do. Welcome to our family&apos;s Chinese Kitchen.</string>
		<string>Bill and TJ Palmer opened the restaurant that would later become Applebee’s. We’ve grown up a lot since then, with almost 2,000 locations in the U.S. and around the world. Here you will always be welcome – for delicious food, in a neighborhood setting, with attentive service, at a great value.</string>
